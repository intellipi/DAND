# Project Overview

In this project, you will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. 
You should use Pandas and NumPy to answer the questions you are most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. 
You will not be required to use inferential statistics or machine learning to complete this project, but you should make it clear
in your communications that your findings are tentative. This project is open-ended in that we are not looking for one right answer.
