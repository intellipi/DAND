    "The project goal was to use machine learning techniques over e-mails and corporate financial data to classify Enron employees into two groups: those involved in the financial scandal, named POIs (persons of interest), and those not. It leverages on computational power and statistical algorithms to identify patterns in known cases to label unknown ones into a group or another. \n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish the task, both financial and e-mail information were summarized by person's name. A list of POIs was manually generated based on individuals who were indicted, reached a settlement or plea deal with the government, or testified in exchange for prosecution immunity. There were total 21 features in the dataset: 14 financial features, 6 email features and the 'POI' feature, the one to be tested against the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 146 data points, each representing one Enron employee. Of those, 18 were flagged as POIs and 128 as non-POIs.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Of the 146 data points (persons), 3 outliers were removed: two that are clearly not persons ('TOTAL' and 'THE TRAVEL AGENCY IN THE PARK') and another with all values equal to zero ('LOCKHART EUGENE E'), which could bring mislead results to the model.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the models, the features values were checked for missing information. The aim was to avoid bias due to 'NaN' concentrated in POIs.   \n",
    "For example, if all POIs have 'NaN' for a specific feature, the algorithm may conclude that \"every time a feature is missing, the person is a POI\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "Two features were dropped because of 'NaN' issue: `restricted_stock_deferred` and `director_fees`. The `email` feature was also dropped, because there's nothing that can be predicted from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step was to create 2 new features to be tested: \n",
    "1. `to_poi_ratio`: the percentage of messages sent to a POI / total messages sent; \n",
    "2. `from_poi_ratio`: the percentage of messages received from a POI / total messages received.\n",
