# Project Overview

In this project, you will play detective, and put your machine learning skills to use by building an algorithm to identify Enron 
Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset. 
In this project, you're working with a real dataset that, by itself, had existed almost stagnantly for years.
